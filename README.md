# PacMen-Exercise
This project tested our skills with manipulating the DOM, as well as recognizing browser boarders. We utilized the <button> tag, and the setTimeout function.
## How to Run:
Clicking the [Add PacMan] button in the top left-hand corner will add a new image of a pacman onto the browsers in a random position. Clicking the [Start Game] button will then cause each added pacman to move at a random speed and in a random direction.
## Future Improvements:
I plan on updating this project using new techniques that we will learn throughout the course.
